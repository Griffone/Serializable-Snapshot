# C++ serializable snapshot object

A tiny exercise to essentially build a serializable hash map to multiple types of objects.
The key is to reduce unnecessary memory footprint of union structs to make it managable.
The serializable_type_t can be changed to suit your needs, for example the Key can be an enum, if all your snapshots have limited number of known fields.

## Features:
- [x] Json-typed map (excluding arrays)
- [x] stream serialization
- [x] stream deserialization
- [ ] saving to JSON file
- [ ] loading from JSON file

## Features that can potentially be implemented in the future:
- [ ] Array type support
- [ ] Correct cross-platform serialization-deserialization
- [ ] Difference calculation
- [ ] Delta compression
